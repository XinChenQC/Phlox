## Sample Data

Sample trajectory files are not included in the repository due to size.

To test with your own data:
1. Create a `data/` directory
2. Add your trajectory files
3. Update the file paths in the examples

## More Examples (Coming Soon)

- `advanced_filtering.py` - Custom network filtering
- `visualization.py` - Plotting reaction networks
- `batch_analysis.py` - Analyzing multiple simulations
- `custom_classifier.py` - Custom reaction classification
